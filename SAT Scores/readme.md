Conclusion:
        There seems to be a positive correlation between Verbal and Math Scores. and a negative correlation between Math, Verbal and rate of paticipation. Perhaps the state highschool population data would show why participation rate is low in states where the Maths and Verbal scores are high? there are also differences in states scores and need population and othereconomic and school information to understand the differences in scores.
